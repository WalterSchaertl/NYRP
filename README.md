# NYRP: New York Regents Preparation
Current project for a website to help prepare for a New York Regents test. 
This is a website built with Django 1.11.2 that lets users study for Regents exams by practicing questions. The user can practice released Regents tests, or they can select units they want to study and get questions just on those topics. After the user is done practicing, they get customized feedback on the areas they missed the most are should study more.
